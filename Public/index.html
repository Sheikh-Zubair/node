                    <h2>What is Diabaties?
                    </h2>
                    <p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when glucose level in blood is too high. Worldwide, it afflicts more
                        than 422 million people. The World Health Organization estimates that by 2030, that number of people
                        living with diabetes will more than double. Today diabetes take more lives than AIDS and Cancer combined.
                        It is a leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, amputations, heart failure and stroke.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How it happens?</h3>
                    <p>Glucose is the main source of energy and it comes from the food we eat. Our body turns food into glucose
                        and at that point, Pancreas releases Insulin, which act as the key to open cells and allow glucose
                        to enter and make energy. If
                        <a href="Pancrease.html#pancrease" title="Page about pancrease" target="_blank">Pancrease</a> does not make enough or any Insulin then glucose level in our blood increases. This
                        increase of blood sugar is called Diabetes. Sometimes people call diabetes “a touch of sugar” or
                        “borderline diabetes.” These terms suggest that someone does not really have diabetes or has a less
                        serious case, but every case of diabetes is serious.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Types of diabaties</h3>
                    <h4>Type 1 diabeties</h4>
                    <p>If you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. Your immune system attacks and destroys
                        the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and
                        young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin
                        every day to stay alive.</p>
                    <h4>Type 2 diabeties</h4>
                    <p>If you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. You can develop type 2 diabetes
                        at any age, even during childhood. However, this type of diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged
                        and older people. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.</p>
                    <aside role="complementary">
                        <p>There are other types of diabeties as well which are less common.</p>

                    <h2>Insulin Pump</h2>
                    <p>An insulin pump is an electronic device. The Insulin pump helps us more closely mimic the way a healthy
                        pancreas functions. The pump, through a Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII), replaces
                        the need for frequent injections by delivering precise doses of rapid-acting insulin 24 hours a day
                        to closely match your body's needs.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How Insulin Pump Work?</h3>
                    <p>The drip feeds insulin into the body through the day and can deliver larger doses of insulin whenever needed,
                        such as before meals. Insulin pumps can also be programmed to deliver specific doses at set times</p>

                <h2 role="heading">What is Pancrease?</h2>
                <p>A large gland behind the stomach which secretes digestive enzymes into the duodenum. Embedded in the pancreas
                    are the islets of Langerhans, which secrete into the blood the hormones insulin and glucagon</p>
                <h2 role="heading">Location of Pancrease</h2>
                <p>The pancreas is located behind the stomach in the upper left abdomen. It is surrounded by other organs including
                    the small intestine, liver, and spleen. It is spongy, about six to ten inches long, and is shaped like
                    a flat pear or a fish extended horizontally across the abdomen.</p>
